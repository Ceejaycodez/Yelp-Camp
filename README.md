# Yelp-Camp
A redone project from the web development bootcamp by Colt Steele . 
YelpCamp is a basic restful full CRUD web appliaction.
It allows users to sign-up and create campgrounds with features like a Title, Location, an image or images, Price and Description. Users can also view existing campgrounds and give a 1-5 star rating and also write a review on them. Users are only allowed to edit and delete camprounds made by them. It also implements a mapping system that shows the location of a campground on a map.
