Users signed in or not will be able to view existing campgorunds with an additional map reference showing the location of each campground.
While signed in, as CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) implies users are able to create campgrounds of their own which possess features such as a Title, Location, Price, decription and also upload an image or images for that campgorund.
